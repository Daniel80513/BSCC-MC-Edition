# BSCC-MC-Edition
Bash Script Command Center - MInecraft Edition

This is an early stage project that i've been making for me and a few friends. It's FAR from complete but i'll add to it as I see a need.

To install run these simple commands.

`git clone https://github.com/kicker22004/BSCC-MC-Edition.git`

Change to Directory

`cd BSCC-MC-Edition`

And to launch do:

`./Install.sh`

This Program is very much Beta but it is at a point where it can be used, use at your own risk....
